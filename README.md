Function Block Diagram Simulator for PLCs written in JavaScript

This project focuses on provided a quick simulator for Function Block Diagrams (FBD) for 
IEC1131 programming of process control equipment. Process control equipment is used in 
manufacturing and includes, but is not limited to, Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs).
This simulator is also meant for users to be able to develop custom blocks to simulate if
need be.
